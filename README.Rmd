# texblocks

Lets be frank, it is not fun to create TeX tables from scratch.

![](tools/README/readme.gif)

In `R` there are a few ways to get around this task by converting a data.frame into latex tables via [huxtable](https://github.com/hughjonesd/huxtable), [pixiedust](https://github.com/nutterb/pixiedust) and [knitr](https://github.com/yihui/knitr). 

But many times you either don't have or don't want to go through a data.frame to get to your table. `{texblocks}` is an attempt to create a natural language with simple operators to quickly create reproducible TeX tables.

## Idea

Assemble LaTeX tabular environments using simple operations.

This would enable us to create any table layout with a consistent user API.

## Proposed Syntax

For a rendered vingette see [basics](https://metrumresearchgroup.github.io/texblocks/articles/basics.html)

Defining a new class of R element `tb` that is the basic structure of the language.

### Joining elements

Let `t1` and `t2` be two objects of class tb.

|  |   |
|:--:|:--:|
| `t1 + t2`  |`r '\u2b1b'` `r '\u2b1b'`|


|  |   |
|:--:|:--:|
||`r '\u2b1b'`|
|`t1 / t2`||
||`r '\u2b1b'`|


Using this language creating a table can be broken down to cell level

`t1 =(``r '\u2b1b'`` + ``r '\u2b1b'`` + ``r '\u2b1b'``) / (``r '\u2b1b'`` + ``r '\u2b1b'`` + ``r '\u2b1b'``)`

would be translated to 

```
1 & 2 & 3 \\
4 & 5 & 6
```

making their combination a natural extension

`t1 + t1`

would translate to 

```
1 & 2 & 3 & 1 & 2 & 3 \\
4 & 5 & 6 & 1 & 2 & 3
```

### Recasting

Converting to `tb` class

  - [numeric](https://metrumresearchgroup.github.io/texblocks/articles/basics.html#single-blocks)
  - [character](https://metrumresearchgroup.github.io/texblocks/articles/basics.html#single-blocks)
  - [matrix](https://metrumresearchgroup.github.io/texblocks/articles/basics.html#matrix)
  - [sparse matrix](https://metrumresearchgroup.github.io/texblocks/articles/basics.html#sparse-matrix)
  - [data.frame/tibble](https://metrumresearchgroup.github.io/texblocks/articles/basics.html#data-frame)
  
texblocks can also be converted back into [`tibbles`](https://metrumresearchgroup.github.io/texblocks/articles/basics.html#as-data-frame) for further data manipulation. 

### Vectorizing

texblocks can also be [replicated](https://metrumresearchgroup.github.io/texblocks/articles/basics.html#replicate) and used as a list with `purrr` verbs and base R [`*apply`](https://metrumresearchgroup.github.io/texblocks/articles/basics.html#list) functions.

### Mutations & Aesthetics

For a rendered vingette see [aesthetics](https://metrumresearchgroup.github.io/texblocks/articles/aesthetics.html)

  - [multirow/multicolumn](https://metrumresearchgroup.github.io/texblocks/articles/aesthetics.html#multicolmultirow)
  - [hline](https://metrumresearchgroup.github.io/texblocks/articles/aesthetics.html#hline)
  - [cline](https://metrumresearchgroup.github.io/texblocks/articles/aesthetics.html#cline)
  
### TODO

A set of elements can be defined to control the table and cell level attributes, eg

  - font: colour, size, face
  - background colour
